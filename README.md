# E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction System

**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
This project aims to address the growing issue of customer churn on a mid-sized B2C e-commerce platform. Recent data shows that over 40% of new users make only a single purchase and never return within 30 days, leading to low customer lifetime value (LTV) and high customer acquisition costs (CAC). The current operations team relies on manual rules and intuition to identify at-risk users, resulting in delayed or inaccurate interventions. Without a data-driven early-warning system, the platform is missing opportunities to retain valuable customers. This project will develop a predictive model to identify users at high risk of churn, enabling timely and personalized retention strategies such as targeted discounts, personalized emails, or product recommendations.

## Stakeholder & User
- **Decision-maker**: Director of Customer Operations, who approves retention strategies and allocates marketing budgets.
- **End-users**: Growth marketing team and campaign managers, who use churn predictions to design and execute weekly retention campaigns.
- **Workflow context**: Every Monday morning, the team reviews a list of "Top 100 High-Risk Users" generated by the model, then deploys targeted campaigns via email or in-app messages during the week.

## Useful Answer & Decision
This project will deliver a **predictive analytics solution** that outputs a churn probability score (0–1) for each active user.  
- **Analysis Type**: Predictive  
- **Key Metrics**: Model AUC ≥ 0.85, Recall ≥ 75%  
- **Deliverables**:  
  1. Trained churn prediction model (Python `.pkl` file)  
  2. Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis and model evaluation  
  3. Dashboard prototype (in notebook) showing top churn indicators and user segments  
  4. Recommended intervention strategies based on user behavior patterns  

This output will enable the marketing team to shift from reactive tactics to proactive retention, improving customer engagement and ROI on marketing spend.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Historical user behavior data (e.g., login frequency, purchase history, cart abandonment) is available in CSV format.
- The model will be retrained weekly due to evolving user behavior.
- No personally identifiable information (PII) will be used or stored.
- Computational resources are limited to local machine or Google Colab (no enterprise cloud access).
- The final model must be interpretable to support business decisions (e.g., using Logistic Regression or XGBoost with SHAP values).

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- The impact of external factors (e.g., holidays, economic trends) on churn is uncertain.
- User behavior may change rapidly after promotions, affecting model stability.
- Some users may be "dormant" rather than truly "churned" — this requires defining a clear churn threshold (e.g., 30 days of inactivity).
- Risk: Model bias against new user segments.  
  Mitigation: Monitor performance across user cohorts and retrain regularly.

## Lifecycle Mapping
Goal → Stage → Deliverable  
- Define problem & scope → Stage 01 → README, GitHub repo, stakeholder memo  
- Collect & clean data → Stage 02 → Cleaned dataset in `/data/processed/`  
- Explore patterns → Stage 03 → Analysis notebook in `/notebooks/eda.ipynb`  
- Build & evaluate model → Stage 04 → Trained model and evaluation report  
- Design intervention strategy → Stage 05 → Recommendation document in `/docs/`  
- Present findings → Final Stage → Final presentation and code handoff

## Repo Plan
Directory structure:  
- `/data/` — raw and processed datasets  
- `/src/` — Python scripts for data preprocessing and modeling  
- `/notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration and prototyping  
- `/docs/` — documentation, stakeholder memo, and reports  

Update cadence: Commit progress at least twice per week. Use descriptive commit messages.
